```
curl -s http://<ip>/status | jq '.'
```

    "last_update_time": 1508174348
  }
}

```


#### **API:** POST  /node
---

      "token": "dfjskjdsfkj"
    }'  http://localhost:8510/node

```


#### **API:** PATCH  /node
---

Update the agent's exchange token. This API can only be called when configstate is "configuring".

    }'  http://localhost:8510/node

```

#### **API:** DELETE  /node
---

Unconfigure the agent so that it can be re-configured. All agreements are cancelled, and workloads are stopped. The API could take minutes to send a response if invoked with block=true. This API can only be called when configstate is "configured" or "configuring". After calling this API, configstate will be changed to "unconfiguring" while the agent quiesces, and then it will become "unconfigured".

**Parameters:**

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| block | bool | If true (the default), the API blocks until the agent is quiesced. If false, the caller will get control back quickly while the quiesce happens in the background. While this is occurring, the caller should invoke GET /node until they receive an HTTP status 404. |
| removeNode | bool | If true, the nodeâ€™s entry in the exchange is also deleted, instead of just being cleared. The default is false. |
| deepClean | bool | If true, all the history of the previous registration will be removed. The default is false. |

**Response:**

code:

* 204 -- success

body:

none

**Example:**
```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X DELETE "http://localhost:8510/node?block=true&removeNode=false"
```


#### **API:** GET  /node/configstate
---

Get the current configuration state of the agent.

**Parameters:**

none

**Response:**

code:
* 200 -- success

body:

| state   | string | Current configuration state of the agent. Valid values are "configuring", "configured", "unconfiguring", and "unconfigured". |
| last_update_time | uint64 | timestamp when the state was last updated. |

**Example:**

```
curl -s http://localhost:8510/node/configstate |jq '.'
{
  "state": "configured",
  "last_update_time": 1510174292
}
```


#### **API:** PUT  /node/configstate
---

Change the configuration state of the agent. The valid values for the state are "configuring" and "configured". The "unconfigured" state is not settable through this API. The agent starts in the "configuring" state. You can change the state to "configured" after you have set the agent's pattern through the /node API, and have configured all the service user input variables through the /service/config API. The agent will advertise itself as available for services once it enters the "configured" state.

**Parameters:**

body:

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| state  | string | the agent configuration state. The valid values are "configuring" and "configured".|


**Response:**

Set the node policy. The node on the exchange will be updated too with the new policy. Properties openhorizon.cpu, openhorizon.arch, openhorizon.memory, penhorizon.hardwareId are buit-in properties which cannot be changed. When openhorizon.allowPrivileged is set to true the service container is allowed to run in the 'privileged' mode if it chooses to. The default value for openhorizon.allowPrivileged is false.

**Parameters:**

body:

The bosy is an array of the following: 

| name | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ---------------- |
| properties   | array | an array of the name-value pairs to describe the policy properties. |
| constraints | string | an array of constraint expressions of the form <property name> <operator> <property value>, separated by boolean operators AND (&&) or OR (\|\|). |


**Response:**

code:

* 201 -- success

**Example:**
```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "purpose",
      "value": "network-testing"
    },
    {
      "name": "group",
      "value": "bluenode"
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "iame2edev == true",
    "MyVar==2"
  ]
}'  http://localhost:8510/node/policy  | jq '.'

```

#### **API:** PATCH  /node/policy
---

Patch the properties or the constraints for the node policy. The node on the exchange will be updated too with the new patch. Properties openhorizon.cpu, openhorizon.arch, openhorizon.memory, penhorizon.hardwareId are buit-in properties which cannot be changed. When openhorizon.allowPrivileged is set to true the service container is allowed to run in the 'privileged' mode if it chooses to. The default value for openhorizon.allowPrivileged is false.

```
curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X PATCH -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{
  "constraints": [
    "iame2edev == false",
    "MyVar==3"
  ]
}'  http://localhost:8510/node/policy | jq '.'

```

#### **API:** DELETE  /node/policy
---

Delete the node policy. The exchange copy of the node policy will also be deleted.
