	"Command line interface for Horizon agent. Most of the sub-commands use the Horizon Agent API at the default location http://localhost (see environment Environment Variables section to override this).\n\nEnvironment Variables:\n  HORIZON_URL:  Override the URL at which hzn contacts the Horizon Agent API.\n      This can facilitate using a remote Horizon Agent via an ssh tunnel.\n  HZN_EXCHANGE_URL:  Override the URL that the 'hzn exchange' sub-commands use\n      to communicate with the Horizon Exchange, for example\n      https://exchange.bluehorizon.network/api/v1. (By default hzn will ask the\n      Horizon Agent for the URL.)\n  HZN_ORG_ID:  Default value for the 'hzn exchange -o' flag,\n      to specify the organization ID'.\n  HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH:  Default value for the 'hzn exchange -u' or 'hzn\n\t  register -u' flag, in the form '[org/]user:pw'. Notice that HZN_ORG_ID can be set \n\t  if org is omitted when HZN_EXCHANGE_USER_AUTH is set.\n  HZN_FSS_CSSURL:  Override the URL that the 'hzn mms' sub-commands use\n      to communicate with the Horizon Model Management Service, for example\n      https://exchange.bluehorizon.network/css/. (By default hzn will ask the\n      Horizon Agent for the URL.)\n\n  All these environment variables and ones mentioned in the command help can be\n  specified in user's configuration file: ~/.hzn/hzn.json with JSON format.\n  For example:\n  %s\n  ": 560,
