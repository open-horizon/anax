%prep
%setup -c

%build
# This phase is done in ~/rpmbuild/BUILD/horizon-<version> . All of the tarball source has been unpacked there and
# is in the same file structure as it is in the git repo. $RPM_BUILD_DIR has a value like ~/rpmbuild/BUILD
#env | grep -i build
# Need to play some games to get our src dir under a GOPATH
#rm -f ../src; ln -s . ../src
#mkdir -p ../github.com/open-horizon
#rm -f ../github.com/open-horizon/anax; ln -s ../../anax-%{version} ../github.com/open-horizon/anax
#GOPATH=$RPM_BUILD_DIR make anax

%install
# The install phase puts all of the files in the paths they should be in when the rpm is installed on a system.
# The $RPM_BUILD_ROOT is a simulated root file system and usually has a value like: ~/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/horizon-1.0.0-1.x86_64
# Following the LSB Filesystem Hierarchy Standard: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.pdf
